# Business

My playground for getting my head around kubernetes, terraform and helm

## Configuring dev environment

Ensure terraform is installed

```
terraform init
```

```
gcloud config configurations create business
```

Create file `./creds/serviceaccount.json` with service account key downloaded from cloud dashboard
